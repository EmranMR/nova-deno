# nova-deno

A Deno extension for Nova.

This extension is a Deno project itself, and is built with esbuild.

Lots of code has been inspired by, if not entirely copied from, [nova-typescript](https://github.com/apexskier/nova-typescript), which has many useful utilities that could apply to any LSP extension for Nova.

It has a few known bugs that need assistance from Panic or Deno.
