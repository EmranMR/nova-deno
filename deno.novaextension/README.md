# Deno ü¶ï

Everything you need for TypeScript and JavaScript development, powered by the
[Deno](https://deno.land) runtime.

- Zero-config Typescript support.
- A complete development toolchain including a **formatter**, **linter**, **test
  runner**, **bundler**, and **language server**.
- Complete support for standard Web APIs like `fetch`, `WebSocket`, or the
  Streams API.
- An audited [standard library](https://deno.land/std).
- Dependencies without node_modules or package.json.
- Secure by default, requiring explicit permission for file, network or
  environment access.

Deno's complete and _fast_ toolchain (built in Rust) is the perfect companion
for Nova. This extension provides the following integrations with Nova:

- Typechecking, linting, completions, code actions, registry import suggestions,
  and more in your editor.
- Tasks in Nova derived from
  [Deno tasks](https://deno.com/blog/v1.20#new-subcommand-deno-task).
- Automatic formatting on save.
- Commands for renaming symbols, caching dependencies, formatting documents, and
  renaming symbols.
- Symbol search and dedicated sidebar.
- Task templates for `deno run` and `deno bundle` commands.
- Global and per-project configuration settings.

Nova also has built-in support for Deno's debugger thanks to its Deno Debug
project task (**Project ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí Add Deno Debug using + in Tasks
section**).

### How is this different to the TypeScript extension?

There is an
[excellent Nova Typescript extension](https://github.com/apexskier/nova-typescript)
by Cameron little. This extension assumes the usage of the Node.js runtime,
which does _not_ have its own formatter, linter, test runner, bundler, etc. and
as such requires several other dependencies and corresponding Nova extensions
for these features.

## Requirements üéí

To use this extension, you must have the Deno runtime installed (v.1.10.3 or
above).
[Installation instructions can be found here](https://deno.land/#installation).

If you use Deno 1.18+, any deno.json configuration files will be automatically
detected and used by this extension.

Support for Deno tasks requires Deno 1.20+.

## Commands ‚å®Ô∏è

- **Cache** - Cache all external dependencies
- **Format Document** - Format with Deno's formatter
- **Rename symbol** - Rename variables, functions, etc.
- **Find Symbol** - Search for symbols in the codebase
- **Restart Deno LSP server** - You shouldn't have to do this, but it's nice to
  have when you start getting angry.

## Configuration options ‚öôÔ∏è

All of the below can be configured at a global and per-project basis (via
**Project ‚Üí Project Settings...**).

- Format on save
- Deno language features
- Linting
- Unstable Deno APIs
- Import map

The following is configurable only at a global scope:

- Trusted and untrusted hosts for Import suggestions

## Shoutouts üì£

Big thanks to Cameron Little's
[excellent Nova Typescript extension](https://github.com/apexskier/nova-typescript)
for providing an excellent reference (and a lot of code) for developing a great
Nova extension.

## Contributing ü§ù

This extension is itself a Deno codebase.
